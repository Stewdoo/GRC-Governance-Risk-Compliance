# GRC-Governance-Risk-Compliance

This repository is a simplified overview of real life scenarios that I was taught during my cohort with Northwestern.

The GRC Scenario file contains a GRC scenario that I created and wrote to simulate a real life scenario that can happen to any organization.

The GRC Summary contains some of the scenarios given to us in class that previews great security practice relating to GRC.
